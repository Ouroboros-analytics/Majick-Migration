## Motivation: 
  *We went into this project hopeful that we would be able to tie changes in the migration patterns of several species to yearly changes in climate.

  * Define the core message or hypothesis of your project.
  ### An analysis of the changes in various species' migration patterns due to climate change
  * Describe the questions you asked, and _why_ you asked them
  ### 
  * Describe whether you were able to answer these questions to your satisfaction, and briefly summarize your findings

* Questions & Data

  * Elaborate on the questions you asked, describing what kinds of data you needed to answer them, and where you found it

## Data Cleanup & Exploration

  * Describe the exploration and cleanup process | We needed 4 pieces of information from our data: Timestamp (we used month and year), Species, Longitude and Latitude. It became clear that researchers have some trouble agreeing on what those 4 words mean. While cleaning our data
  * Discuss insights you had while exploring the data that you didn't anticipate | Initially we expected any changes in the migration 
  * Discuss any problems that arose after exploring the data, and how you resolved them
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during exploration, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Data Analysis

  * Discuss the steps you took to analyze the data and answer each question you asked in your proposal
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during analysis, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Discussion

  * Discuss your findings. Did you find what you expected to find? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your analysis?

* Post Mortem

  * Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them
  * Discuss any additional questions that came up, but which you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next, if you had two more weeks?

* Questions
  * Open-floor Q&A with the audience
